Our team has two main communication channels, Discord (our primary one) and email (the secondary). On discord, we have four text channels: general, pull-requests, bugs, and due-dates. The purpose of the channels is to keep our team informed and facilitate communication within the team. We will be using Github for source control and Jira for project management.

We used Figma to design our UI. Currently, the team meets every 2 days online through Discord. In these meetings we discuss work related to the sprint, such as what was done, blocks encountered, and tasks to be worked on next. Team members can bring up issues such as task dependencies and development blocks. 

We make decisions by discussing the pros and cons, and make a decision by voting. 

We try to resolve any uncertainties about the assignment through discussion using the voice channel, and if we are still not able to find a good solution, we decide to consult the class piazza.

At the end of every sprint we will reflect on the team’s successes and identify areas of improvements which we take forward to the next phase.

We determine priority based on our client’s priorities. Then, priority is determined by the number of dependent tasks, followed by the time it takes to finish the task. Larger task and tasks with more dependencies will have higher priority.

Point System:

We define points by how many days it should take to complete a task. Each person can only have at most 10 points assigned to them per sprint.

Team Reflection:



*   Have smaller and more focused team meetings
*   Have a meeting agenda so that we have a clear goal to accomplish.
