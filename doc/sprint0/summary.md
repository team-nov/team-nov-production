**Part 4: The Key Principles**

Key Principle: Simple user interface/experience over performance - The application should provide an easy-to-navigate interface for all users even if it incurs a hit to performance

Key Principle: Accessibility over complexity - The application should prioritize accessibility for all users even if it results in a lack of powerful and more useful features
